# Call for Paper

Cyber threats refer to any type of malicious activity that targets computer systems, networks, or devices with the intent to compromise their security, steal sensitive data, or cause damage. Cyber threats can take many forms, including viruses, malware, spyware, phishing, ransomware, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, among others.

In recent years, cyber threats have become a major concern for individuals, businesses, and governments alike. The increasing reliance on technology and the internet has created new vulnerabilities and opportunities for cyber criminals to exploit. Cyber threats can come from anywhere in the world and can target anyone or any organization, regardless of their size or industry. It is important to take cybersecurity seriously and take steps to protect against these threats.

We invite submissions of original research papers, case studies, and reviews for presentation at the Workshop on Cyber Threats. The workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to discuss the latest advances and challenges in the field of cybersecurity.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to: 

* Threat modeling and risk assessment
* Vulnerability analysis and exploitation
* Malware analysis and detection
* Intrusion detection and prevention
* Cyber incident response and recovery
* Cyber threat intelligence and information sharing
* Cybersecurity policy and regulation
