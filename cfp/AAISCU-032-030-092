## <font face="Console">Call for Papers</font>

&emsp;&emsp;With the development of artificial intelligence theory and technology, the application scope of artificial intelligence in various fields is also expanding. In order to strengthen the construction of national cyberspace security and promote artificial intelligence to achieve more academic innovation and Technological Development in more Cyberspace Security related fields, "2021 Sichuan University artificial intelligence society" will be held in Chengdu in May 2021 under the guidance of the school of Cyberspace Security of Sichuan University. The conference will conduct academic exchanges and discussions on typical applications of Cyberspace Security, analyze hot issues, propose technological innovations and show results. To this end, the conference will solicit academic papers in this field from home and abroad.

&emsp;&emsp;In order to showcase the latest research results of Sichuan University in artificial intelligence algorithms and its applications, and to deepen the technical exchanges between multiple application fields, the conference has extensively collected academic papers in this field in the School of Network Security.

&emsp;&emsp;In order to ensure the availability and professionalism of the research, AAISCU will review the papers according to the research directions and innovation points corresponding to their research fields.
