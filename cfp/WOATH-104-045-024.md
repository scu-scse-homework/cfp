## Overview

Nowadays, advanced threat operators bypass traditional means of cyber defense mechanisms and cross the line to achieve their goals of espionage.  What's worse, according to the anonymity of cyberspace, they launch stealthy attacks continuously without revealing their identities. The WOATH aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in computer security to present the latest technologies in advanced threat hunting, helping the world to detect and trace advanced threats.

## Topics of Interest
Refereed paper submissions are solicited in all areas relating to advanced threat hunting, including but not limited to:

- Advanced threat detection
    - detection and mitigation of binary exploitation
    - detection of vulnerabilities below the operating system (VBOS)
    - detection of covert channels
    - detection and analysis of hardware trojan
    - detection of supply chain attacks

- Cyber attribution
    - Malware family classification
    - TTPs extraction techniques
    - Frameworks for threat attribution
    - Vulnerability analysis on offensive tools
    - Social engineering attacks against threat operators
