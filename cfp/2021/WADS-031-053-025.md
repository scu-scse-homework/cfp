## Introduction

Artificial intelligence is the most dynamic research domain of this last decade, and as such has been increasingly penetrating other research domains, and all sectors of society. AI-driven security solutions have already found applications in next-generation firewalls, automatic intrusion detection systems, encrypted traffic identification, malware detection, and so on. The Workshop on AI-Driven Security (WADS) seeks embryonic, disruptive, and unconventional ideas on AI-driven security that benefit from early, in-depth, and constructive feedback. Submissions typically address current limitations of cybersecurity, discuss problems from an entirely novel angle, leading to new solutions.
