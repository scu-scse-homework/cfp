 （Malware Detection Based on Machine Learning）
</div>
<div align=left>
Machine learning has been widely used in security-related tasks such as biometric identity recognition, malware and network intrusion detection, and spam filtering, to discriminate between malicious and legitimate samples. there has been a surge of efforts to apply machine learning to security, including spoofing attacks, jamming attacks on data transmission, and other attacks that target spectrum sensing and signal classification tasks.

However, simple machine learning methods exhibit inherent limitations in translating theory to practice when handling the complexity of optimization for emerging applications with high degrees of freedom. In order to strengthen the construction of the cyberspace security guarantee system, innovate and develop national cyberspace security technologies, and promote academic prosperity and technological progress in the fields of cyberspace security and trusted computing. will be held in June 2021 Held in Chengdu. The conference will conduct academic exchanges and display results on the theoretical hot spots, key technologies and typical applications of cyberspace security. To this end, the conference solicits academic papers in this field from home and abroad. the challenge in applying Artificial Intelligence for APT(advanced Persistent Threat ). Such challenges include but are not limited to risks and regulatory issues as well as other associated factors related to processing, detection, and availability for secure communication. The goal of this Issue is to bring together researchers to focus on understanding security challenges of detection, Technical scope of this issue includes, but is not limited to:
