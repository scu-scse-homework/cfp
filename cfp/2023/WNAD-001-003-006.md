# Call For Papers

## WNAD 2023

_China,Chengdu_
_The 1st Meeting of the Workshop on Network Attack and Defenses
Shuangliu,Chengdu,May 24, 2023_

Network security plays a crucial role in countering cyber threats, and network attack and defense (NAD) is an important means to achieve this. NAD involves using technical means to attack or protect target systems, networks, or data by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in computer or internet systems. Its development has gone through multiple stages, from technical security in the cold war era to expanding into diverse and complex areas. Today, NAD faces new challenges and opportunities, with the potential for artificial intelligence to be one solution for enhancing network security.
We welcome papers that cover theoretical, empirical, and practical aspects of network security. Submissions should provide novel contributions to the field, including new approaches and  methodologies.
