## CALL FOR PAPERS

The International Conference on Open-Source Intelligence and Public Opinion Monitoring (OSI&POM) is a premier IEEE conference presenting research in the open-source intelligence and public opinion monitoring technology. For eight years, OSI&POM has been a research forum for academic, industrial, and government researchers. We encourage submission of high-quality papers reporting original work in both theoretical and experimental research areas that can be applied to OSINT gathering and analysis or POM techniques.

### Topics for OSI&POM 2021

The conference seeks submissions from diverse communities, including corporate and academic researchers, open-source projects, system and security administrators, software engineers and application domain experts. Topics of interest focused on open-source intelligence and public opinion monitoring include (but are not limited to):

- Multi-source target website page extraction
- Verification code recognition
- Human-machine recognition confrontation
- Social robot detection
- Social network analysis
- Social networking security and privacy
- User mining across social networks
- Individual mental disease detection
- Text sentiment analysis
- Secure electronic commerce
- False information detection and generation
- Sensitive information identification
- Automatic detection and tracking of major events

We particularly encourage submissions describing:

- Rumor detection
- Individual depression detection
- Opinion spam recognition
- Jargon detection and identification

### Conflicts of Interest

The conference requires cooperation from both authors and program-committee members to ensure a fair review process. For this purpose, authors must report all program-committee members who, in their opinion, have a conflict of interest and therefore may not be able to provide an unbiased review. Mandatory declared conflicts of interest include current or former doctoral advisor/advisee, members of the same institution, close family members, and recent co-authors (within the past 2 years). For any other declared conflict, authors are required to explain the nature of the conflict, which will be reviewed by the Conference Co-Chairs. The chairs reserve the right to request further explanation and can remove non-mandatory conflicts at their discretion.
