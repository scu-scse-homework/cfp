## Call for Papers
---
**Sichuan University NSTC 2021, August 1-3, 2021**  
With the continuous development of information technology, all kinds of network attacks and other attacks occur frequently, and the attack methods are constantly innovative. How to combine the idea of active defense and passive defense to build a network security protection system from the inside out is the current research hotspot. 

In order to promote the academic prosperity and industrial development in the field of Cyberspace Security, the first "Conference on network security and trusted computing", sponsored by Sichuan University and hosted by the school of Cyberspace Security of Sichuan University, will be held in Chengdu in August 2021. 

The conference will combine the endogenous security based on trusted computing, behavior analysis, traffic monitoring, network security and other technologies Machine learning and other border protection are two major topics, from the inside to the outside of the network security protection academic exchanges and achievements display. Therefore, the conference on network security and trusted computing solicits academic papers from scholars and researchers at home and abroad.


### Scope of the papers
---

**Network intrusion detection**

 - User behavior analysis and exception discovery
 - Network traffic monitoring and situation awareness
 - Communication behavior analysis and threat identification
 - Machine learning and network security
 - Feature extraction and recognition of encrypted traffic
 - Tracing and positioning of network attack
 - Small sample attack feature extraction and detection
 - Host behavior analysis and anomaly detection
 - Unknown attack detection

**Trusted Computing**

 - Trust chain of trusted system
 - Trusted measurement mechanism
 - Trust construction of trusted terminal
 - Remote proof
 - Trusted network connection
 - Trusted computing applications
 - Trusted computing evaluation
 - Virtual machine trusted operating environment
 - Remote verification and management of trusted virtual machine

### Paper Requirements
---

The paper must be the latest research result of an original paper that has not been published and has not been submitted to academic journals and other academic conferences.  Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings.

The manuscript can be written in Chinese or English, and generally does not exceed 15 pages.The English format is based on the contributions of IEEE Transactions on networking, and the Chinese paper refers to the paper format of Engineering Science and Technology (formerly Journal of Sichuan University (Engineering Science Edition).

### Submission
---
The submitted papers are submitted directly by e-mail, and the e-mail address includes:

 - <2020xxxxxx044@stu.scu.edu.cn>
 - <2020xxxxxx003@stu.scu.edu.cn>
 - <2020xxxxxx020@stu.scu.edu.cn>
 - <2020xxxxxx016@stu.scu.edu.cn>

For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:  

 - Accept: Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference, possibly after making minor changes with the oversight of a shepherd.
 - Major Revision: Papers in this category are considered to be promising but need additional work (e.g., new experiments, proofs, or implementations). Authors will be given the opportunity to resubmit such papers, with appropriate revisions, in which case they should clearly explain in a well-marked appendix how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers. The revised paper will then be re-evaluated, and either accepted or rejected.
 - Reject: Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Papers rejected from the first review cycle may not be submitted again (even in revised form) to the second review cycle.

### Important Dates
---

Submission Deadline ：May 25, 2021  
Acceptance Notification ： July 10, 2021  
Meeting Date ： August 1-3, 2021  



### Diversity and Inclusion
---
NTSC is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our community. If you have suggestions, concerns, or complaints related biases or sexual harassment, we encourage you to reach out to the Conference Co-Chairs. We are committed to protecting the anonymity of such reports and helping to address your concerns. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community.

We encourage the authors to be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions. Please check the link for more information.
