## 2022 SCU Software Security Conference

### **Call for Papers**

Next-Generation Networks (NGNs) integrate the functionalities of a plethora of established and emerging technologies such as 6G, Internet of Things(IoT), edge intelligence, IPv6, and Software Defined Network(SDN). NGN is a body of key architectural changes in telecommunication core and access networks.With the development of terminal devices, NGNs can provide a large number of intelligent services and user-defined applications. Due to the increasing complexity of systems and the exponential growth of the amount of data exchanged over networks, new state-of-the-art NGN management solutions are required. For a instance, NGNs using SDN connect geographically-distributed employees, support mobile workforces, and are the key to stability and efficiency for all things data, voice and media.NGNs hope to achieve ultra-fast data rates and minimal latency in wireless communication and networking. However, such promising features introduce new challenges on trust, security and privacy, which motivate research and practice.

This workshop aims to bring together recent advances on future network and system management solutions, which will ensure reliable, secure, efficient and autonomous services and applications. It welcomes original and innovative perspectives on theories, methodologies, schemes, algorithms, and systems related to NGNs. Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:

* Secure application and service in next-generation networks.
* Secure and trustworthy operations and management for next-generation networks.
* Blockchain solutions to support service delivery in NGN.
* Applications and services using UAVs to support autonomous vehicles in NGN.
* Emerging services and applications management for IoT.
* IPv6 deployment and transition technologies.
* Intelligent network and service virtualization.
* Software Defined Networking, Network Function Virtualization and network automation.
* Novel techniques for improving the security, reliability, performance, and scalability of SDN architectures.
