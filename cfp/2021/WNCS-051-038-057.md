The Workshop on Network Content Security has been the premier forum for information research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners. We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in any aspect of security or privacy. Papers may present advances in the theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and measurement of  network content security

Topics of interest include:

* Secure information flow
* Information hiding detection
* Rumor detection
* image manipulation detection
* Violent video recognition

This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; WNCS is interested in all aspects of network content security . Papers without a clear application to security or privacy, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.
