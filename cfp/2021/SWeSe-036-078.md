By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. Alternative arrangements will be made if global health concerns persist. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact hach.chp@gmail.com.

A major mission of the SWeSe Association is to provide for the creation and dissemination of new knowledge. In keeping with this and as part of SWeSe's open access policy, the Proceedings will be available online for registered attendees before the Workshop and for everyone starting on the opening day of the technical sessions. SWeSe also allows authors to retain ownership of the copyright in their works, requesting only that SWeSe be granted the right to be the first publisher of that work. See our sample consent form for the complete terms of publication.

### Invited Talks and Panel Discussions

Invited talks and panel discussions will be held in parallel with the refereed paper sessions. Please submit topic suggestions and talk and panel proposals via email to hach.chp@gmail.com by Thursday, February 4, 2022.
