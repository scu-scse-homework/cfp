# Annoucement and Call for Papers

**The 1st SCU Symposium on Federated Machine Learning for User Privacy and Data Confidentiality**

**June 8-22, 2023, Chengdu, China**

*Sponsored by unnamed scholars*

## Symposium Overview

The 1st SCU Symposium on Federated Machine Learning for User Privacy and Data Confidentiality is aimed at providing a platform for SCU students and professional teachers to exchange academic progress and share the latest research results of federated machine learning. The symposium will be held in Chengdu, China in April 2023. We welcome SCU students and professional teachers to submit papers, and encourage high-quality, original papers, especially those exploring cutting-edge technology and having practical application significance.

Please note that the deadline for paper submission is May 24, 2023. We highly recommend that you submit your paper at your earliest convenience, to ensure ample time for us to arrange the review process and prepare the proceedings.

## Symposium Topics

Federated machine learning is an emerging machine learning method that achieves collective intelligence by sharing model parameters among multiple devices or data sources without the need to centralize the original data set in one place. However, due to the involvement of multiple parties and data sharing, federated machine learning also brings many challenges in terms of privacy and security. Therefore, the theme of this symposium will focus on the application and research progress of federated machine learning in privacy protection, in order to promote the exchange and exploration of the academic community in this field.

This symposium will cover the following topics, but not limited to:

- The fundamental theories and technologies of federated learning.
- The applications of privacy computing in federated learning.
- Privacy protection algorithms in federated learning.
- The applications of federated learning in edge computing and the Internet of Things (IoT).
- Security and privacy risk analysis in federated learning.
- Practical application cases of federated learning and privacy computing.

## Submission Policies

Please note that submitted papers must comply with the following requirements:

- The content of the paper must be relevant to the theme of the symposium.
- The paper must be original work and not have been published or simultaneously submitted in any other academic journals or symposiums.
- The paper must be written using LaTeX and submitted in PDF format.
- The paper must have a minimum of 4 pages and a maximum of 12 pages (including references).
- The paper should follow academic writing conventions and formats, including citation and reference formats.

The submitted papers will be evaluated based on the following review criteria:

- All submitted papers will undergo a rigorous peer-review process, conducted by the symposium's professional committee.
- The review will primarily consider the academic value, originality, technical quality, clarity, and relevance to the symposium theme of the paper.
- All accepted papers will be published in the symposium proceedings and submitted to relevant academic databases and retrieval systems.

We look forward to your participation and contribution, and to exploring the latest research progress in federated machine learning and privacy protection with you. If you have any questions or need further information about the symposium, please feel free to contact us at xxxx@scu.edu.cn.
