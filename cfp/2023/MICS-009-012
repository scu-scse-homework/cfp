# Call For Papers
## MICS 2023

The 1st Workshop of Multimedia Information and Content Security(MICS) will be held in Chengdu, China,
on May 18-21, 2023. This workshop will be organized by School of Cyber Science and Engineering,
Sichuan University.

In this decade, social network, online media, mobile Internet and Internet of Things developed rapidly.
People deal with a large amount of multimedia information such as audio, images, and videos every day.
However, the significant development of computer science and artificial intelligence make it easier to
tamper multimedia information and the abuse of multimedia information is also emerging in an endless stream.
Modifying the digital image, audio, and video data become simple and interesting, and it’s posing a huge
challenge to multimedia information and content security. How to protect the security of multimedia information
and content has become a common and important problem faced by mankind.

Information security is the intersection of multimedia processing and cyberspace security. MICS is an annual
workshop that focuses on information and content security of image, video, audio and other fields. It will
show the recent advances and address existing challenges in security, privacy, cryptography. This workshop
will feature world-class plenary speakers, exhibits, and high quality peer reviewed oral and poster presentations.

The Workshop of MICS invites researchers, practitioners, and academics to submit original research papers,
case studies, and review articles (including latest research, innovative methods, new algorithms and breakthroughs
based on previous studies) in the following areas:

1. Multimedia information hiding and digital watermarking
+ Steganography and steganalysis for audios, images or videos
+ Numeric steganography in semantic and structural terms
+ Copyright protection based on fingerprints or digital watermarks
+ Fragile or semi-fragile digital watermarks
+ ...

2. Forensics analyze
+ Multimedia information tampering
+ Multimedia forensics(copy-move, splicing, remove, etc.)
+ The generation and detection of Deepfake
+ Fake multimedia forensics and anti-forensics
+ Multimedia source device identification algorithm
+ ...
3. Multimedia privacy and cryptography
+ Privacy technologies and mechanisms
+ Encryption and decryption algorithms for audios, images or videos
+ Signal Processing in the encrypted domain
+ Encryption and reliable transmission
+ Cryptography
+ Biometrics
+ Anonymous
+ ...
4. Artificial intelligence and multimedia processing
+ Signal/Audio/Image/Video processing based on machine learning or deep learning
+ Feature extraction and analysis of multimedia information
+ Sensitive information identification, information retrieval
+ Encoding and decoding of multimedia information
+ Audio sampling, compression, synthesis , speech recognition and speaker identification
+ Image filtering, enhancement, compression, segmentation and noise
+ Video compression and detection
+ ...

## Review Policy

All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind reviewing
and peer review process. And all submissions must represent new and original work. Published papers are
not allowed to participate in this workshop. The specific review process is as follows:

### Double-Blind Review
All papers submitted must be anonymous. MICS2023 follows the principle of double-blind review. Absolutely,
the authors do not know who is commenting on their paper, and jury members do not know who is the author
of the submitted paper. Therefore, the submitted papers do not include author information, citations or
discussions on relevant works, so as to make the identity of the author obvious.

### Peer Review Policy
Each paper should be reviewed by at least two reviewers. Sometimes, a specific manuscript which have big
differences about the review opinions will be reviewed by new additional reviewers who invited by the editorial
department. To make high-quality, timely, fair and meaningful reviews, the peer reviewers are selected based
their professional knowledge and ability.
In addition, peer review should also follow the above dual-blind principle. Peer reviewers can not let out the
contents of the manuscripts to anyone. Without the permission of the editors, they must keep the contents of
the manuscripts confidential.

### Review Results
There are three kinds of results after the review part, which are accepted, to be modified and rejected.
If the paper is accepted for publication, at least one of the authors should attend this workshop and present
research results with slides or pre-recorded videos. If the paper should be modified, authors can revise the
paper based on the suggestions written by the experts and then submit it again. The revised paper will be
transvalued. Rejected paper can not be submitted again.
