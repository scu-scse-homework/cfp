# STDTI&ID COMPASS 2021

（Seminar on Traffic driven network threat identification and intrusion detection）

24 May – 28 May 2021 (virtual)

</div>

Cyberspace has become the "fifth frontier" after land, ocean, sky and space. As one of the key national information infrastructures, the Internet has played an important role in politics, military, economy, transportation and other fields. At the same time, the frequency and scale of network attacks are increasing year by year. These attacks have caused huge economic losses, and even seriously threatened national security and social stability and development. Therefore, how to effectively prevent attacks from the network has become an urgent problem.

At present, the existing security protection schemes include firewall, data encryption, intrusion detection system and other technologies, which can effectively sense network attacks to a certain extent and provide response decisions for security managers. With the continuous development of network intrusion technology, Trojans, zombies and other means of attack, as well as the diversification of network applications and computer programs, the efficiency of traditional virus library and pattern recognition detection methods has gradually decreased, but no matter what kind of attack methods, as long as the use of the network media, its attack behavior will be shown in the network traffic, the impact of network traffic Mining has become the first defense line of cyberspace protection and the main battlefield of intrusion detection.

With the continuous development of cloud storage technology and big data mining technology, the speed, efficiency and accuracy of online and offline traffic analysis have been improved. With the combination of machine learning and deep learning, migration learning, traffic threat identification and intrusion detection, the main battlefield of network countermeasure of traffic detection has ushered in new development. Researchers in academia and industry are coping with the new challenges in cyberspace with more intelligent and higher speed.

This seminar (stdti & ID) is collecting original technical papers to deal with threat identification in various network application scenarios and network topology environment, and network intrusion detection. It is expected to use more intelligent modes and methods, use artificial intelligence technology, optimize the existing detection technology, or solve the main problems of current traffic in storage management, flow, identification and other aspects The requirements include but are not limited to the following topics:


## topics：

* Collecting and caching for massive network traffic

* Scalable and customized protocol restore and load restore for high-speed flow environment

* Comprehensive and effective expression of network traffic

* Build a network traffic characterization system that can adapt to different use scenarios and different application requirements

* Solve The problem of sparse samples, small samples and limited samples of unknown samples

* Solve the environmental restriction in the network environment such as industrial control network, private network and complex network

* Solve the problem of fuzzy concept, interpretability and so on

* Solve the problem of limited data sources in scenarios of encrypted traffic, risk analysis, prediction and early warning

* Solve the problem of limited directional, controllable and operable variants of network traffic samples and characteristics

* Using efficient machine learning model to solve traffic classification

* Run artificial intelligence method for traffic mining

* Solve the complexity of feature engineering caused by protocol breadth in malicious traffic detection

* About the new network attack recognition, apt attack recognition, unknown attack recognition

Manuscripts should conform to the standard format as indicated in the Information for Authors section of the Paper Submission Guidelines.All manuscripts to be considered for publication must be submitted by the deadline through Manuscript Central.Please refer to the paper writing format of Sichuan University Natural Science Edition for the paper format.
