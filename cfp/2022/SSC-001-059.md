##  Call For Papers

SSC(Software Security Conference) focuses on evaluating and predicting software security and improving the reliability and innovation of vulnerability mining products. With the wide application of various systems in various fields, the unprecedented demand for data security and information security has brought great challenges to the current system vulnerability detection field. Serious vulnerabilities can lurk in commonly used systems. Recently, Fuzzing have shown effectiveness and scalability as an exploitability tool. Fuzzing is a method to discover software bugs and vulnerabilities by automatic test input generation which has found tremendous recent interest in both academia and industry. Readers are encouraged to submit papers which disclose significant technical knowledge, exploratory developments and applications of fuzzy systems. Emphasis is given to the apply of a variety of technologies such as stain analysis, symbol execution, static analysis, fuzzy testing, etc.

##  Topics of interest

The topics of the conference call for papers cover development and analysis methods (models) in the software development life cycle, including but not limited to the following topics:

- Optimization of mutation strategy, mutation method and mutation scheduling mechanism.
- Improvement of seed selection algorithm.
- Fuzzy measures and fuzzy integrals.
- Aggregation, operators, fuzzy relations.
- The main trustworthiness attributes that affect software reliability (i.e. security, security, and maintainability)
- Secondary trustworthiness attributes that affect software reliability (eg: survivability, resilience, robustness, etc.)
- Threats to reliability (i.e. failures (defects, etc.), errors and failures)
- Reliability methods (failure prevention, elimination, fault tolerance, and prediction)
- Optimal control of dynamic systems.
- adaptive and dynamically evolving process control.

## Submission Guidelines:

Submitted papers must contain original work, which has neither been previously published nor it is currently under review by another journal or conference. Previously published or accepted conference papers must contain at least 40% new material to be considered for the special issue. All papers will be peer-reviewed by at least three independent reviewers. Requests for additional information should be addressed to the corresponding guest editor.

Papers will be reviewed according to criteria appropriate to each category. ISSRE welcomes original research that explores new scientific ideas, provides new evidence for established research directions, or reflects on practical experience.

## Important Dates:

- Submission deadline: May 13, 2022
- Initial notification: May 20, 2022
- Final acceptance/rejection notification: August 18 , 2022
- Meeting date: October 24-27, 2022
