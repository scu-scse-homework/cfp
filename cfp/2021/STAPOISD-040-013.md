## Call for Papers

The Internet of Things can bring huge economic opportunities to all walks of life, and can support exciting innovations in various fields, including child care, elderly care, healthcare, energy, manufacturing, and transportation.

Technical experts and analysts predict that in the future, IoT devices and applications will be more widely used and devices, services, and applications involving the IoT field will also continue to develop. Therefore, organizations are often eager to take advantage of these business advantages. However, due to very real IoT security issues, many companies are right to be cautious when pursuing the benefits of IoT solutions. IoT deployments expose global enterprises to new and unique security, privacy, and compliance challenges.

Although IoT devices may seem inconspicuous or too professional to be dangerous, general-purpose computers that are actually connected to the Internet have real risks. They may be hijacked by attackers and cause problems beyond IoT security. Even the most common devices that are compromised via the Internet can become dangerous, including surveillance of baby video monitors and interruptions in service to life-saving medical devices. Once attackers have control, they can steal data, disrupt service delivery, or use computers to commit any other cybercrime. Attacks that endanger the IoT infrastructure will not only cause data leakage and operational unreliability, but also cause physical damage to the facility, or worse, to the personnel operating or relying on these facilities.

IoT connectivity covers a large and often unfamiliar attack surface, and IoT devices and applications have large amounts of personal, operational, and company data. Therefore, IoT security experts need to pay attention to more than the confidentiality, integrity and availability of these traditional information security requirements. Internet of Things cyber security experts are certainly worried about data leaks and other cyber attacks.
The purpose of this special issue is to convene researchers from different fields to focus on understanding the attack threats faced by IoT devices and corresponding security strategies, and to design innovative solutions with the help of the most advanced related technologies.

## Submission Guidelines

All papers  must be submitted by the deadline through the <a href=https://workspace.jianguoyun.com/inbox/collect/3df3cbea184747cfae47776ac0a6ba94/submit>website</a>.

### Paper Formatting


All submissions must obey the following formatting requirements.

- Paper bodies (all content before references and appendices) must be between 3 and 4 single–spaced pages, including figures and tables, followed by as many pages as necessary for references and optional appendices.
- Reviewers are not required to read any appendices or consider them in their review. Authors should thus ensure that the core paper is complete and self-contained. For example, if the appendix provides details of a proof or experiment, the body should summarize the key result.
- The paper body must include some statement about ethical considerations. This could be simply the sentence “This work does not raise any ethical issues”, or where relevant (for example, but not exclusively, a paper involving human subjects), the discussion may be more detailed.
- If submitting to the experience-track, authors should indicate as such in the submission form and paper title.
- Papers must be formatted for printing on Letter-sized (8.5” by 11”) paper. Paper text blocks must follow ACM guidelines: double-column, with each column 9.25” by 3.33”, 0.33” space between columns. Each column must use 10-point font or larger, and contain no more than 55 lines of text.
- It is your responsibility to ensure that your submission satisfies the above requirements. You must use LaTeX, and you need to make use of [this template for ACM conference proceedings](https://github.com/scyue/ccp-sigcomm18). With the older versions of this template you must add “10pt” to the documentclass command to meet the submission requirements. The current template sets 10pt by default. (Unlike the official template, it only includes an example for conference proceedings.)

Your goal as an author is to produce a clearly readable submission within the above constraints. Authors are strongly discouraged from violating the formatting requirements with the aim of including additional material: **submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed**.

Please make sure that your submitted paper satisfies the following:
- Per the anonymity guidelines, you must remove any author names.
- You must provide an abstract, and it should be of no more than 200 words.
- You must number the pages.
- You must submit papers in PDF (Portable Document Format).
- You should ensure that labels and symbols used in graphs and figures are legible, including the font sizes of tick marks, axis labels, legends, etc.
- You should limit the file size to less than 15 MB. Contact us if you have a file larger than 15 MB.


### Policy
All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind reviewing, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to make a good-faith effort to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Common sense and careful writing will go a long way towards preserving anonymity. Minimally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:
- Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page. For experience-track papers, it is OK (but not necessary) to reveal company or system names but NOT author names; this applies to both the title block and the main body of the paper.
- Remove acknowledgment of identifying names.
- Use care in naming your files. Source file names (e.g., “Alice-n-Bob.dvi”) are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments.
- Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by another author.
- Do not embed pointers to external sources (e.g., public GitHub repositories) that leak author identity or affiliation.

In addition to submitting an anonymized paper, double-blind reviewing requires that both authors and reviewers take care while reviewing is happening.

-  Authors are welcome to release their paper in a non-peer-reviewed location, but you should not broadcast information about the publication widely.
- All reviewers are expected to not actively attempt to deanonymize papers. In either case, if there is a breach of double-blind reviewing, the author and the reviewer should report it to the chairs.

### Ethics Considerations
Papers must follow basic precepts of ethical research and subscribe to community norms. These include respect for privacy, secure storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent if human subjects are involved or other people are placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential, beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing potential harm to an individual), and risk mitigation. Authors may want to consult the [Menlo Report](https://catalog.caida.org/details/paper/2012_menlo_report_actual_formatted/) and the [ACM ethics policy](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) for further information on ethical principles, and they may find the [Allman/Paxson paper in IMC 2007](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2007/papers/imc80.pdf) helpful for a perspective on ethical data sharing.
