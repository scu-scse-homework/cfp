Digital Forensics is a rapidly growing field focused on process of preservation, identification, extraction, and documentation of computer evidence in a legal way. While traditional digital forensics filed continue attracting researcher's interest, recent  exploration of digital forensics, IoT, cloud computing, block chain and AI has sparked a new wave of research interest. Our new forum aims to facilitate the research collaborations between the relevant communities in response to the rapidly growth of digital forensics. 

Topics of interest comprise, but are not limited to:

**Digital Evidence Extraction and Analysis**

**eDiscovery**

**Legal aspect of forensics**

**Network Forensics**

**Anti-Forensics Techniques**

**Mobile Forensics**

**Log Analysis**

**Digital Forensic Information Visualisation**

**Internet of Things (IoT) Forensics**

**Big Data in Digital Forensics**

**Cloud forensics**

**Artificial Intelligence in Digital Forensics**

**Blockchain for Digital Forensics**
