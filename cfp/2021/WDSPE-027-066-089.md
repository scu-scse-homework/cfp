### Overview

With the development and popularization of Internet technology, more and more individuals use the Internet. People generate massive amounts of data in the process of using the Internet. The sources of these data include personal computers, Internet of Things devices, mobile communication devices and other devices. In fact, many people and organizations are keen to use Internet technology to bring convenience, but they do not pay attention to the security and privacy of the data they generate. In recent years, as data leakage has become more and more common, people have realized the importance of privacy protection, so data security and privacy-enhanced technologies have become new research hotspots.

### Aim & Scope

The purpose of Workshop on Data Security and Privacy-Enhanced is to offer a timely venue for researchers and industry partners in communications and networking domains to present and discuss their latest finding and result in data security and privacy-enhanced related work.

### Topics & Interest

We focus on the security and privacy issues in communications and networking fields from the following perspectives, but are not limited to:

- Security and Privacy in Big Data Environments(e.g., Social Networks, Smart Cities, Medical Systems, Genomics, Cyber-Physical System)
- Secure and Privacy-Preserving Computation and Data Processing(e.g., Differential Privacy, Homomorphic Encryption, Multi-Party Computation, Oblivious RAM, Secure Enclaves,  Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Proxy Re-encryption, Secret Sharing, Garbled RAM, Garbled Circuits)
- Human/System Interaction(eg., Complex System Interfaces, Privacy Policies for Big Data Systems and Technologies)
- Anonymous communication and censorship resistance
- Defining and quantifying privacy
- Security and Privacy of Fog Computing
- Security and Privacy of Blockchain
- Security and Privacy of Federated Clouds and Edge Computing
- Human factors, usability, and user-centered design of privacy technologies
- Information leakage, data correlation, and abstract attacks on privacy
- Interdisciplinary research connecting privacy to economics, law, psychology, etc.
- Machine learning and privacy
- Transparency, robustness, and abuse in privacy systems

### Submission Guidelines

1. We welcome the submission of the following papers:
   - Regular papers (8-10 pages, including references), will be allocated 20 minutes of lecture time and 5 minutes of -question time.
