## Call for Papers

### Overview

With the increasing expansion of cyberspace,attacks on the network have also become rampant. Cyber ranges have emerged as a response to the need of high-fidelity environments for testing, training, exercising capabilities related to cyber security.In addition, network security research and industry development needs such as network attack and defense confrontation training, network risk assessment and analysis, large-scale network security project verification, network security product display, and network security innovation and entrepreneurship are imminent.**SCREC** aims to to bring together researchers advancing, developing and maintaining cyber ranges (e.g., cyber-physical labs, clouds and other virtual platforms) supporting cyber security training, tests and exercises.

### Aim & Scope

The aim of the workshop is to exchange and discuss technologies and infrastructures required to simulate real systems with cyber incidents (e.g., simulation of benign or malicious users, evaluation frameworks, capability measurement).

We invite papers from researchers and practitioners working in security, systems engineering, situational awareness and related areas to submit their original papers to this workshop. Case studies (successful or not) related to cyber ranges are also encouraged.

### Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Design of large-scale exercises
- Simulation of benign or malicious users
- Event monitoring and evaluation
- Data management
- Automated machine configuration and deployment
- Applications to test cyber security properties
- Security and privacy challenges
- Human factors in training and exercises
- Event operating environments and scenarios modelling
- Simulation of tools and components from various systems (e.g., industrial control systems, cyber-physical systems, legacy systems, etc.)
