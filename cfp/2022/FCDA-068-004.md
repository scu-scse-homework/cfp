### Submission
---
The submitted papers are submitted directly by e-mail, and the e-mail address includes:

 - <2021xxxxxx068@stu.scu.edu.cn>
 - <2021xxxxxx004@stu.scu.edu.cn>

For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:

 - Accept: Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference, possibly after making minor changes with the oversight of a shepherd.
 - Major Revision: Papers in this category are considered to be promising but need additional work (e.g., new experiments, proofs, or implementations). Authors will be given the opportunity to resubmit such papers, with appropriate revisions, in which case they should clearly explain in a well-marked appendix how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers. The revised paper will then be re-evaluated, and either accepted or rejected.
 - Reject: Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Papers rejected from the first review cycle may not be submitted again (even in revised form) to the second review cycle.
