## Call for paper
The asymmetry of vulnerability information has become the key factor leading to the disparity of power in network war. Worms, shock waves, concussion viruses, and wannacry viruses that broke out in recent years have been transmitted by software or system vulnerabilities. In addition, advanced network attacks (such as apt attacks) even cross and combine multiple vulnerabilities, aiming to bypass the firewall, antivirus software, intrusion detection system, destroy the security of the isolation network, break through the core network nodes and enter the intranet, and carry out subsequent penetration attacks (such as stealing, modifying, encrypting important data, destroying core facilities, etc.). In particular, the undisclosed 0day vulnerability is often used as the ultimate secret weapon, and sometimes even plays a decisive role.

In view of the importance of software vulnerability in network attack and defense, researchers from major software manufacturers, universities and scientific research institutes have carried out a lot of research on vulnerability mining technology.

The purpose of this issue is to promote the research progress in the field of vulnerability mining. We welcome novel research on modelling, algorithm design and implementation, optimization, and applications in the use of these technologies to vulnerability research.

Topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to:

- Vulnerability prevention
- Vulnerability analysis
- Exploitation and defenses
- Hardware vulnerabilities
- Situational awareness
- Active probinga
