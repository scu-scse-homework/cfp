## Call For Papers
The Internet of Things (IoT) facilitates the interconnection and data exchange of modern objects across every aspect of our lives, including our homes, cars, and even our bodies. By 2025, forecasts suggest that there will be more than 75 billion Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices in use. However, due to the open nature of Internet connectivity, IoT brings a big challenge for the security community; hackers may exploit critical vulnerabilities in a wide range of IoT applications and devices for carrying out their nefarious activities. As a result, IoT security has already become an issue of high concern. Undoubtedly, in terms of offensive security, there is an urgent need to understand IoT-related attacks. This will help toward designing the appropriate security mechanisms.
This special issue focuses on IoT-related attacks and defences, and aims to solicit original research papers that discuss novel ways in compromising and protecting IoT networks and devices. We would like to cordially invite you to participate in this special issue by submitting your current research results within a research article or a short communication. Review articles are also considered provided that the topic of the review is discussed in advance.

## Topics of interest
We encourage the submission of high-quality contributions regarding the recent advances in IoT attacks and defenses. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the ones listed below.
- Malware and unwanted software for IoT
- Vulnerability analysis and reverse engineering for IoT
- IoT Cyber crime
- Denial-of-Service attacks for IoT
- IoT security and privacy
- IoT forensic techniques
- Usable security and privacy for IoT
- Intrusion detection and prevention for IoT
- Cyber intelligence techniques for IoT
- IoT infrastructures and mitigation techniques
- IoT Hardware security
- Cyber physical systems security
- Adversarial learning for IoT
- Security measurement for IoT
- IoT security visualization techniques

## Submission Guidelines:
Submitted papers must contain original work, which has neither been previously published nor it is currently under review by another journal or conference. Previously published or accepted conference papers must contain at least 40% new material to be considered for the special issue.
All papers will be peer-reviewed by at least three independent reviewers. Requests for additional information should be addressed to the corresponding guest editor.

## Important Dates:
- Submission deadline: June 4, 2021
- Initial notification: June 5, 2021
