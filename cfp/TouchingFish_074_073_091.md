### Long paper

Long papers must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included.

Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references. Final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.

### Short paper

Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:

+ A small, focused contribution
+ A negative result
+ An opinion piece
+ An interesting application nugget
**IMPORTANT: Anonymity Period**:
AISM 2021 adopts new policies for submission, review, and citation.

For the background of the new policies, refer to the [online version](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation).

**Formatting Requirements**:
