# Call For Papers 
## CLIS 2022 | BY data_group

_China Chengdu_
_The 1st Meeting of the Computational Linguistics and Information Security_
_ShuangLiu, ChengDu, April 4-28_

### Overview
The Computational Linguistics and Information Security mainly focus on linguistic science and content-based text information security in Natural Language Processing(NLP). Computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a computational perspective. Work in computational linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other cases, the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system. Content-based text information security is a research branch of information security, which focuses on security issues of natural language text on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Sina Weibo, and so on.

### Conflicts of Interest
The conference requires cooperation from both authors and program-committee members to ensure a fair review process. For this purpose, authors must report all program-committee members who, in their opinion, have a conflict of interest and therefore may not be able to provide an unbiased review. Mandatory declared conflicts of interest include current or former doctoral advisor/advisee, members of the same institution, close family members, and recent co-authors (within the past 2 years). For any other declared conflict, authors are required to explain the nature of the conflict, which will be reviewed by the Conference Co-Chairs and the Track Chairs. The chairs reserve the right to request further explanation and can remove non-mandatory conflicts at their discretion.
