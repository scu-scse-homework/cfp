# ACMSCU COMPASS 2021

（Association for Computing Machinery of SCU）

24 May – 28 May 2021 (virtual)

</div>

---


In order to strengthen the construction of the national cyberspace security guarantee system, innovate and develop national cyberspace security technologies, and promote academic prosperity and technological progress in the fields of cyberspace security and trusted computing. Sponsored by the Computer Society of Sichuan University (**SCU**), guided by the SCU Cyberspace Security Professional Teaching Steering Committee, and co-organized by the SCU Information Security Institute Professional Committee, the "2021 Sichuan University Computer Society Academic Workshop" (**ACMSCU COMPASS 2021**) will be held in May 2021 Held in Chengdu. The workshop will conduct academicexchanges and display results on the theoretical hotspots, key technologies and typical applications of cyberspace security. To this end, the workshop solicits academic papers in this field from home and abroad.

With the rapid development of the information industry and the widespread use of information technology, information security has become a major concern in our society. In the information society, in addition to being a part of human society and the physical world, all persons are considered to belong to the information space. It is generally accepted that safety and reliability in human society are closely related to the security and trust associated with the information space. To ensure a safe, harmonious, prosperous and progressive human society, we must ensure that there exist security and trust in both the human society and information space simultaneously.

To ensure security and trust in the information space, there needs to be an integrated approach to implementing cryptography, network security, information system security, content security and other security technologies. Trusted computing is an effective system security technology that has been rapidly developing in recent years, and which has been widely used.

The Internet of Things, Big Data and Cloud Computing are hot topics in the current information field, The Internet of Things promotes the informatization of society by connecting the social space with physical space. Then, Big Data is generated in the information society. Also, the processing of Big Data relies on Cloud Computing. All of these systems require Trusted Computing and other information security technologies to ensure that security and trust are maintained.

To show the latest research results of information security and trusted computing in Sichuan University, and to promote technological communication in these fields, the workshop solicits academic papers in this field in School of Cyber Security.
