# 2021 Workshop on Cyber Security and Data Science（CSDS）

### Introduction

We cordially invite you to submit your paper and attend the Workshop on Cyber Security and Data Science,witch will be held in SiChuan,China September 5th-8th 2021,and it will be jointly organized by the Cyber Security,Sichuan University. The Cyber Security scholars and data processing expert will be welcomed,the workshop will be hybrid,allowing physical and online attendance.

Cybersecurity is the set of technologies,process and practices designed to protect networks,computers,programs and data from attack,damage or unauthorized access.It is widely used in various fields,and has a profound impact on the current network environment.Data science is the research of data collection, processing, analysis and other technologies based on big data environment,It is one of the important directions of information construction,To maximize the social and economic benefits of technology, issues of interoperability, data and service mash-ups, the development of open platforms, and standardization across technology layers have to be addressed. The technological disruption is generating an impact on society and leading to a new industrial revolution. This social and industrial change presents new technological environments constituted by ubiquitous systems and large amounts of information, which requires a change in the way how cybersecurity is applied. The use of big data, machine learning, data science, data mining, strengthens the cognitive skills of security analysts to face new forms of cybersecurity attacks. This new trend, called cognitive security, poses new challenges for researchers and companies to seek proactive security proposals according to this technological change.

the workshop on Cyber Security and Data Science（CS-DS）will be  held in Sichuan University for the first time,The workshop aims to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, and concerns as well as practical challenges encountered and solutions adopted in the fields of Data Science and Cyber Security.
