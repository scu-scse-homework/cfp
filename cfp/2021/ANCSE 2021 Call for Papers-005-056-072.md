# Call for Papers

### Overview

This proposal is distributed on behalf of the Academic Norms for Cyber Science and Engineering (ANCSE) to be held in this semester of 2021. This conference aims at bringing together post-graduate students, researchers and practitioners from School of Cyber Science and Engineering of SCU to discuss and exchange their experiences, lessons learned, and insights related to computer, network and communications security.

Technical papers and panel proposals are solicited. Authors are encouraged to write the abstract and introduction of their paper in a way that makes the results accessible and compelling to a general computer-security researcher. All submissions will be reviewed by the Program Committee and accepted submissions will be published.

### Paper Submission Information

For each submission to one of the two review cycles, one of the following decisions will be made:
- Accept: Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference.
- Minor Revision: Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference, if and only if they undergo a minor revision and the revision is determined satisfactory by their shepherds.
