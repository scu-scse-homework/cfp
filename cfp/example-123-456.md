# Submission Information
ICS2021 welcome both long and short papers and uses a double-blind review process. Each submission will be reviewed by three program committee members. Each Submission should follow the ICS 2021 guidelines.
## Long paper
Long papers must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included.

Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references. Final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.

## Short paper
Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:

+ A small, focused contribution
+ A negative result
+ An opinion piece
+ An interesting application nugget
**IMPORTANT: Anonymity Period**:  
ICS 2021 adopts new policies for submission, review, and citation. 

Most importantly, the policies define an anonymity period, which starts on April 28nd, 2021 (11:59pm PDT).

During the anonymity period,you may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available to the general community,update a non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, update a non-anonymized version, advertise an anonymized or non-anonymized version on social media, or take any other action that would compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.

For the background of the new policies, refer to the [online version](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation).

**Formatting Requirements**:  

Both long and short papers must using the [LaTeX style](https://emnlp2018.org/downloads/emnlp18-latex.zip) files or [Word template](https://emnlp2018.org/downloads/emnlp18-word.zip),or use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles will be rejected.



# Presentation Requirement
All accepted papers must be presented at the conference in order to appear in the proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for EMNLP 2018. Accepted papers will be presented orally or as a poster (at the discretion of the program chairs based on the nature rather than the quality of the work).
