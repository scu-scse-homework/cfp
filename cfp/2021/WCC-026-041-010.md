# call for paper

Cloud computing has been widely used in various fields, including medical, education, government agencies, commercial companies, etc. At the same time, with its flexible scaling, resource pooling and other characteristics, many other forms of network are also using the cloud to improve their processing ability. Cloud computing also provides platform and computing support for the current massive data processing. Attack and protection against cloud has become an important part of network security.

The focus of this workshop is the research on cloud computing security, including the security of network system in the cloud, virtualization security, trusted cloud, cloud platform intrusion detection and anomaly detection, cloud native security, disaster recovery backup and chaos engineering, and big data privacy security. If you are as interested in the above questions as we are, you are welcome to contribute.

## Manuscript guidelines and submission information
Language: English or Chinese

Paper size : A4, 3-4pages without references

Paper format:
+ English paper use IEEE format(you can get it from https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
+ 中文投稿使用四川大学学报工程科学版模板(你可以从下方链接获取 http://jsuese.ijournals.cn/uploadfile/news_images/jsuese_cn/2021-03-04/%E3%80%8A%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E4%B8%8E%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E3%80%8B%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87%E6%8A%95%E7%A8%BF%E6%A8%A1%E6%9D%BF.doc)

Anonymous Submissions: We implement a double-blind reviewing process. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities of institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper. Authors' prior work should be preferably referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded. Submissions that violate these requirements will be rejected without review. The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.

All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.
