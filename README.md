# CFP Submission

For each CFP, please follow the steps below:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new file in the `cfp` folder
  1. The name of the file should have the format of
     `WORKSHOP_SHORT_NAME-XXX-YYY[-ZZZ].md`, where `WORKSHOP_SHORT_NAME` is the
     abbreviation of the workshop while XXX, YYY and optionally ZZZ are the
     last 3 digit of the organizers' student ID.
  2. The content of the file should follow the same structure as in `cfp/example.md`.
     - `organizers` is the list of organizers, including their names and student
     IDs
     - `title` is the name of the workshop
     - `shorttitle` is the abbreviation of the workshop.
     - `only-for-homework` indicates whether the organizers only submit the CFP
       to complete the homework (`true`) or they are willing to organize a real
       mini-workshop (`false`).
     - `accept-chinese-submission` is whether this workshop accepts Chinese
       submissions (`true`: Chinese/English, `false`: English).

     The content of the CFP should be placed in the main text block in English.
 3. Submit a pull request to this repository.
